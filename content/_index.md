Welcome.

This site is a lightweight Hugo starter that works with the Website Factory workflows.
It’s designed for **evergreen** pages: clear explanations, simple checklists, and
practical “do this / avoid that” guidance.

If you’ve just bootstrapped a new niche, your next step is to run the bootstrap workflow
to generate a titles pool, then let the factory workflow turn those titles into pages.

Nothing here is professional advice—treat it as general information and a starting point
for your own research.
